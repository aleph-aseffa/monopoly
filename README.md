# Monopoly
This project is an implementation of the classic Monopoly game in Python and allows multiple people to play a text-based version of the game together. Soon, I'll be adding a GUI and the ability to play against an AI for more fun! I built this game to improve my Python, OOP skills, and project management skills.

# Usage
To begin playing the game, first clone the repository and extract the .zip file.
Navigate to the folder and open the monopoly_driver.py file. The game will now open:

It's important to remember these instructions.

The player can check on their status (e.g. viewing their balance, cards owned), take actions (mortgage properties, sell properties, construct houses), or roll the dice and move. Only rolling the dice will change the turn to the next player, so you can run all the other actions you want until you are ready to move.

Here's an extract from a sample round of Monopoly:

This continues until there is only one player remaining that is not bankrupt. At this point, the game will end and print out who won.

# Roadmap
There are quite a few features I plan on implementing. Most notable ones are the AI and the ability to add players at run time (this is currently hard-coded into the program). I will update this section with short-term and long-term plans soon.
